# Yubi Test (Laravel + Vue) Full Stack Application

A small-scale sales order web application built with a Laravel backend, a Vue.js frontend, and fully containerized using Docker. This project includes features like contact filtering, call simulation, and call logging.

## Project Structure

This project is divided into two main directories within the repository:

* `/yubi-test-backend`: Contains all Laravel application files.
* `/yubi-test-frontend`: Contains all Vue.js 2 application files.

The main control file, `docker-compose.yml`, is located in the project root.

## Setup & Installation

Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yogaap24/salespond-test.git
    cd salespond-test
    ```

2. **Run with Docker Compose**
    This command will build the images for both the backend and frontend, then start all containers. The database migration and seeding processes will run automatically via an entrypoint script.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

3. **Done! Application is Ready**
    Wait a few moments for all containers to stabilize.
    * **Frontend Application (Vue.js)** is accessible at: `http://localhost:3000`
    * **Backend API (Laravel)** is accessible at: `http://localhost:8000`
    * **Example API Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8000/api/sales-orders`

## Technical Approach & Assumptions

### Technical Approach

* **Full Stack Containerization**: The entire application, both frontend and backend, runs inside Docker containers orchestrated by a single `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root.
* **Startup Automation**: Utilizes an entrypoint script in the backend container to automatically run permissions fixes and `php artisan migrate --seed` every time the container starts. This simplifies the setup process.
* **Reverse Proxy**: The frontend Nginx container acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding all API requests (`/api/*`) to the backend container. This decouples the frontend from the backend's network address and avoids potential CORS issues.

### Assumptions

* The project is run in an environment that supports Docker and Docker Compose.
* The API is open (no authentication) as it was not specified in the task requirements.
* Initial data is generated by database seeders for demonstration and development purposes.
